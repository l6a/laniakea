# Laniakea

Laniakea is both an open source software stack and a set of best
practices that enables supercluster computing with container
technologies.
It uses GitOps to manage multiple tenants on a wide range of computing
resources, including grid, multi-cloud, and HPC, thereby allowing each
tenant to efficiently use the computing resource available.
Its emphasis on reproducibility makes it ideal for computation- and
data-intensive science.
