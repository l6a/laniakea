# Laniakea

Laniakea is both an open source software stack and a set of best
practices that enables supercluster computing.
It uses GitOps to manage multi-tenant on multi-cloud/hybrid-HPC-Cloud,
thereby allowing each tenant to efficiently use computational resource
available.
Its emphasis on reproducibility makes it ideal for computation- and
data-intensive science.
